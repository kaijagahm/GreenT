A web app for exploring grapheme-color synesthesia.

## What is grapheme-color synesthesia?

According to Wikipedia, grapheme-color synesthesia is "a form of synesthesia in which an individual's perception of numerals and letters is associated with the experience of colors."

I had to look that up, because even though I (Kaija) have had this type of synesthesia all my life, I'm only just starting to learn about what it is and how it works.

## What is this app?

I built this app as a way of demonstrating to my friends what letters and numbers "look like" to me (i.e. what colors I associate with them--I don't literally *see* these colors, although some synesthetes do!).

The app was heavily inspired by Bernadette Sheridan's website [synesthesia.me](https://synesthesia.me/), but I wanted individuals to be able to input their own colors. 

## How to use

The app is currently deployed to https://kaijagahm.shinyapps.io/greenT/. Feel free to play around with it!
